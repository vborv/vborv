<h4>About me</h4>

I am a student on my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer, with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in both frontend and backend development.

- Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - HTML y CSS
  - JavaScript
- Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating on open-source projects.
- Ask me anything! I'm happy to help if it's something I know. ðŸ˜‰
- Outside of tech, I love reading, painting, and drawing. I also enjoy discovering new ideas and perspectives through books, art, and technology.
